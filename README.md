# Very_Basic_Ideas
I first learned to code when I was in class 9/10 in 2018/19. At that time, I wrote some simple programs to solve some basic coding problems.
Those are now very easy (can be rewritten in a more efficient way, too), but still memorable for me.
In this repository, at first, I only uploaded those codes. Later, I decided to add some more codes that also solve some basic mathematical problems.
